    "notes": "Create more breadcrumb mixture than you need and place it in a separate container. That saves time putting the ingredients together. You can be creative with the spices and add any others that you think appropriate. I prefer chicken tenderloins to chicken breasts since they are less tough and smaller. Reheat from fridge using Air Fryer for 3 minutes to keep them crisp.",
