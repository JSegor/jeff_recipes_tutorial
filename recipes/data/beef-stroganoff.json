    "notes": "Modified original recipe to reduce the amount of egg noodles by half and doubled the amount of mushrooms. I also added a bit of cream cheese as well. The best way to reheat leftovers is to put the servings into the Instant Pot, add 1 cup of beef broth and pressure cook 4 minutes. Quick release. If it is too watery add 1 tablespoon of flour. Also add a bit more sour cream. Tastes just as yummy.",
