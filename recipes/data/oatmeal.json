    "notes": "Don't use instant oatmeal or steel cut. Serve with dark brown sugar, coconut cream, raspberries, blueberries, bananas, etc. You might find the clean-up a bit messy. Make sure you clean the lid's pressure valves and anti-block shield for obstruction and empty the condensation container. I fill the liner completely with cold water after emptying the oatmeal for easy cleaning.",
